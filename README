Kextstat ASLR

A small util to kernel extensions with true address in Mountain Lion due to KASLR
 
(c) fG!, 2012, 2013 - reverser@put.as - http://reverse.put.as
 
Note: This requires kmem/mem devices to be enabled
Edit /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist
add kmem=1 parameter, and reboot!

This version can work with all Mountain Lion versions out of the box and doesn't
need anymore supplied values.
It should work with any future OS X versions if OSArray class doesn't change.

Enjoy,
fG!


Change log:

v0.1 - Initial version
v0.2 - Retrieve kaslr slide via kas_info() syscall. Thanks to posixninja for the tip :-)
v0.3 - Cleanups
v1.0 - Use diStorm to find sLoadedKexts so everything is dynamic
       The only dependency is on OSArray class, since we are using fixed offsets
